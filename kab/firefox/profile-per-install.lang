;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
Abeddil meqqren deg Firefox: Imuɣna yettwanefken


;What’s Changed
Acu Ibedlen


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.
Zik, akk isebeddiyen n Firefox beṭṭun yiwen n umaqnu s wudem amezwer. Tura, Firefox iseqdac imuɣna yemgaraden i yal asbeddi n Firefox (ula d isbeddiyen n Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, neɣ Firefox ESR). Ayagi ad yerr Firefox d urkid ugar ticki teddi seg usbeddi n Firefox ɣer wayeḍ deg yiwet n tmacint.


;How Dedicated Profiles Work
Amek teddun imuɣna yettunefken


;Firefox saves information such as bookmarks, passwords and user preferences in a set of files called your profile. This profile is stored in a separate location from the Firefox program files.
Firefox yesseklas talɣut am tecraḍ n yisebtar, awalen uffiren akked ismenyifen deg meṛṛa ifuyla yettusemman amaɣnu. Amaɣnu-a ad yettwaḥrez beṛṛa n yifuyla n wahil Firefox.


;The installation you choose as your primary Firefox installation will keep your previously shared profile data like bookmarks, history and passwords.
Asebeddi i tferneḍ d agejdan, ad ak-yeḥrez amaɣnu-ik yezrin win igebren ticraḍ-is n yisebtar, azray-is akked wawalen-is uffiren yettwaskelsen.


;You have not lost any personal data or customizations. Any previous profile data is safe and attached to the first Firefox installation that was opened after this change.
UR tesruḥeḍ ula d yiwen n usefku udmawan. Akk isefka-ik ttwaḥerzen s wudem aɣelsan daɣen ttwakcamen seg usbeddi amezwaru n Firefox i teldiḍ deffir ubeddil-a.


;All of your Firefox installations will now have separate profiles.
Meṛṛa isebdaden-ik n Firefox ad ilin deg yimuɣna yemgaraden.


;What You Need to Do
Dacu tesriḍ ad txedmeḍ


;If you do nothing, each installation will have a separate profile. This means your profile data will be different on each installation of Firefox.
MA yella ur txeddmeḍ kra, yal asebded ad yesɛu amiḍa imanniden. Aya yemmal-d d akken isefka n umaɣnu ad mgaraden seg usebded ɣer wayeḍ.


;You can change which installation uses which profile using the profile manager. Directions on how to use the profile manager are available on <a href="%(support)s">this support page</a>.
Tzemreḍ ad tafeḍ anwa asbeddi i yesseqdacen amaɣnu s umsefrak n yimuɣna. Iwellihen ɣef useqdec-is llan deg <a href="%(support)s">usebter-a n tallelt</a>.


;While profiles are now connected to each installation of Firefox, you can use your Firefox Account to keep them in sync. If you would like all of your profile data to be the same on all installations of Firefox, we recommend you sync all of your profiles with a Firefox Account.
Deg lawan anida yal asebeddi icudd ɣer umaɣnu-is, tzemreḍ ad tesqedceḍ amiḍan-ik Firefox akken ad tḥerzeḍ amtawi. Ma tebɣiḍ meṛṛa isefka n yimuɣna-ik ad cudden ɣer yiwen n usbeddi Firefox, ad k-nwelleh ad temtawiḍ meṛṛa imuɣna-ik s umiḍan Firefox.


;A Firefox Account is the easiest way to make your profiles consistent on all of your versions of Firefox. You also get additional benefits like sending tabs and secure password storage.
