;Find your best browser for speed, privacy and security.
वेग, गोपनीयता आणि सुरक्षिततेसाठी सर्वोत्तम ब्राउझर शोधा.


# HTML page description
;So many browser options, but there’s only one that works best for your needs. The best browser for you should offer both speed and privacy protection.
इतके ब्राउझर पर्याय असतानाही आपल्या गरजांसाठी एकाच सार्थ ठरतो. आपल्यासाठीच्या सर्वोत्तम ब्राऊझरने वेग आणि गोपनीयता संरक्षण पुरावावयास हवे.


;Privacy, speed, and security.
गोपनीयता, वेग आणि सुरक्षितता.


;How to choose the best browser for you.
आपल्यासाठी सर्वोत्कृष्ट ब्राउझर कसा निवडायचा.


;The internet has become as essential as electricity and running water, so choosing the best browser for you is more important than ever. The internet is a second office, a teacher and sometimes a medical advisor, even if your actual doctor would prefer you didn’t look up your symptoms online.
इंटरनेट हे वीज आणि पाण्यासारखे जीवनावश्यक बनले आहे, म्हणून आपल्यासाठी सर्वोत्तम ब्राउझर निवडणे सध्या फार महत्वाचे आहे. इंटरनेट एक दुसरे कार्यालय, शिक्षक आणि कधीकधी वैदिक सल्लागारही आहे, जरी आपल्या खऱ्या डॉक्टरांनी ऑनलाईन लक्षणे पाहू नका असे सांगितले तरी.


;In the mid-nineties, Netscape, Internet Explorer and AOL dominated the landscape. It was a simpler time when the sweet melody of dial-up internet rang across the land. You learned the meaning of patience waiting for web pages to load. Back then, all that mattered was browser speed.
नव्वदच्या दशकाच्या मध्यात Netscape, Internet Explorer आणि AOL यांनी सत्ता गाजवली. डायल-अप चे मधुर ध्वनी सर्वत्र पसरला तेव्हाच काळ साधा होता. पृष्ठ लोड होईपर्यंत आपलयाला धीराचा अर्थ उमगला. तेव्हा फक्त ब्राउझरचा वेग महत्वाचा होता.


;Today is a different story. Ads, privacy hacks, security breaches, and fake news might have you looking at other qualities in a browser. How does the browser protect your privacy? Does it allow trackers to follow you across the web? Does it built to multitask and handle many computer and internet operations at once?
आजची स्थिती वेगळी आहे. जाहिराती, गोपनीयता चोरी, सुरक्षा उल्लंघन आणि खोट्या बातम्यांमुळे कदाचित आपण ब्राउझर मध्ये वेगळी वैशिष्ठ्ये शोधाल. ब्राउझर आपली गोपनीयता कशी सुरक्षित ठेवतो? ट्रॅकरला आपला मागोवा घेऊ देतो का? तो एकाच वेळी अनेक कार्ये, संगणक हाताळण्यास आणि इंटरनेट प्रक्रिया करण्यास सक्षम आहे का?


;When you use a browser for everything, it needs to be fast. But for the same reason, it needs to be private. A browser has access to everything you do online, so it can put you at real risk if it doesn’t have strong privacy features.
जेव्हा आपण ब्राउझर सर्व गोष्टींसाठी वापरता,तेव्हा तो जलद असायला हवा. पण त्याच कारणासाठी तो खाजगी पण असायला हवा. आपण ऑनलाईन जे काही करता त्याची ब्राउझर ला माहिती असते, म्हणून जर त्याच्याकडे सबळ गोपनीयता वैशिष्ठ्ये नसतील तर तो आपल्याला वास्तविक जोखिमेत टाकू शकतो.

;If you’re wondering what it means to have a private or fast browser, here’s a breakdown of three things a browser should have.
आपण खाजगी किंवा वेगवान ब्राउझरचा अर्थ काय असा विचार करत असल्यास, ब्राउझरमध्ये असलेल्या तीन गोष्टींची फोड येथे आहे.


;A browser built for speed.
वेगासाठी बनवलेला ब्राउझर.


;A browser is still a tool, so it makes sense that you’ll want to pick the best one for the job. If you’re a human who needs to work to survive, you’ll need a fast internet browser. One thing to keep in mind is a browser that runs third-party trackers is more likely to be slower than a browser that doesn’t. Third-party trackers are cookies, and while you can’t see them, they are running in the background of the site, taking up precious time. The more third-party trackers a browser blocks, the faster it can run.
ब्राउझर शेवटी एक साधनच आहे, म्हणून आपल्याला सर्वोत्तम हवा असेल यात तथ्य आहे. जर आपण जगण्यासाठी काम करणारे मनुष्य असाल तर आपल्याला एक जलद इंटरनेट ब्राउझर लागेल. लक्षात ठेवण्याजोगी एक गोष्ट म्हणजे तृतीय-पक्ष कुकीज चालवणारा ब्राउझर त्या न चालवणाऱ्यापेक्षा संथच असतो. तृतीय-पक्ष ट्रॅकर म्हणजे कुकीज असतात आणि जरी त्या दिसल्या नाहीत तरी पार्श्वभागात मौल्यवान वेळ फस्त करत असतात. ब्राउझर जितक्या जास्त तृतीय-पक्ष कुकीज अवरोधित करेल तितका तो जलद चालेल.


;This is one of the many reasons to choose the Firefox browser: Firefox blocks third-party trackers by default. We have other reasons and we’ll get into those later.
Firefox ब्राउझर निवडण्यामागचे अनेक कारणांपैकी हे एक कारण आहे: Firefox पूर्वनिर्धारीतरित्या तृतीय-पक्ष ट्रॅकर अडवतो. इतरही अनेक करणे आहेत पण ती नंतर पाहू.


;A browser that puts safety first.
एक ब्राउझर जो सुरक्षितता प्रथम ठेवतो.


;Remember the last massive data breach? If not, it’s probably because it happens so often. Companies hold on to customer data, like their personal or financial information, and hackers steal it. If you’re making safety a priority, then a secure internet browser is the best browser for you.

;There are a few ways a browser can help its users stay secure. A browser that is up to date with the latest security tech can help protect your computer and websites from unwanted visitors, such as malware or computer viruses.

;The second is not storing too much user data. Hackers can’t steal what’s not there, which is why Firefox keeps a minimum amount of information about its users. <a href="%(data)s">Firefox knows</a> if you use the browser and your general location <a href="%(privacy)s">but not the name of your childhood pet or your favorite color.</a>

;Last but not least, a safe browser should offer tools to help you keep an eye on your accounts. Think of alerts that go straight to your email if any of your accounts get breached or icons that tell you whether a website is encrypted, (i.e., if it’s a good idea to enter your credit number on a shopping site).

;Firefox is offering something new to keep you safe: <a href="%(monitor)s">Firefox Monitor</a>. It’s a free service that will alert you if there are any public hacks on your accounts and let you know if your accounts got hacked in the past. Another neat feature is the Green Lock. It looks like a small green icon at the top left side of the browser window. If you’re on Firefox and see the green lock, it means the website is encrypted and secure. If the lock is grey, you might want to think twice about entering any sensitive information.

;We visit hundreds or even thousands of websites each day, and you can’t expect users to make security and privacy decisions for each of these sites. That is why a browser that gives you more control is so important - because it offers real, meaningful protection.

;A browser that minds its business.
एक ब्राउझर जो स्वतःचे कार्य करतो.


;Privacy on the web is a hot button issue. If privacy is number one on your list of priorities, you want to look for a browser that takes that seriously. When choosing the best private browser for you, look at the tracking policy and how a browser handles your data. These seem like technical questions, but they’re the reason some browsers are more private than others.

;Trackers are all those annoying “cookies” messages you get on airline sites. These third-party trackers know where you click and can be used to analyze your behavior. A private browser should give users the option to turn off third-party trackers, but ideally, turn them off by default.

;Another way to stop trackers from tracking is using private mode to browse. Any browser that claims to be private should offer browsing in private mode.
