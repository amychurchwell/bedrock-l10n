;While these guidelines / code of conduct are specifically aimed at Mozilla’s work and community, we recognize that it is possible for actions taken outside of Mozilla’s online or inperson spaces to have a deep impact on community health. (For example, in the past, we publicly identified an anonymous posting aimed at a Mozilla employee in a non-Mozilla forum as clear grounds for removal from the Mozilla community.) This is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions among our communities about appropriate boundaries.

;Expected Behavior
Perilaku yang Diharapkan


;The following behaviors are expected of all Mozillians:
Perilaku berikut diharapkan dari semua Mozillian:


;Be Respectful
Hormat


;Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.

;Be Direct but Professional
Berbicara Apa Adanya tetapi Profesional


;We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We <em>must</em> be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.

;Be Inclusive
Menjadi Inklusif


;Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.

;Remote (on video or phone)
Remote (on video or phone)


;Not native language speakers
Bukan penutur bahasa ibu


;Coming from a different culture
Berasal dari budaya yang berbeda


;Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”
Menggunakan kata ganti selain “he” atau “she” (dalam bahasa yang menggunakan kata ganti sesuai gender)


;Living in a different time zone
Tinggal di zona waktu yang berbeda


;Facing other challenges to participate
Menghadapi tantangan lain untuk berpartisipasi


;Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.
Pikirkan tentang bagaimana Anda dapat membantu menumbuhkan cara alternatif untuk berkontribusi atau berpartisipasi. Jika Anda merasa Anda mendominasi diskusi, mundurlah. Beri jalan bagi suara-suara lain dan dengarkan secara aktif.


;Understand Different Perspectives
Memahami Perspektif Berbeda


;Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.

;Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences
Hargai dan Tampung Persamaan dan Perbedaan Kita


;Mozillians come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect Mozillians to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.

;Lead by Example
Memimpin dengan Keteladanan


;By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for <a href="%(mission)s">Mozilla’s mission</a>.
